  <h1 class="maintitle">Understanding Chronic Conditions</h1>
  <h2 class="subtitle">Embracing Facts to Inspire Hope</h2>
  <p class="mainparagraph">Discovering a family member's Chronic Myeloid Leukemia diagnosis felt like our world fell apart, leaving us feeling shattered. Despite doctors' reassurances that a normal life was achievable with proper medication and  backing their assurances with data, our fear blinded us, making it hard to see beyond the worst outcomes.
    Chronic diseases, unlike temporary illnesses, require ongoing management but don't spell a hopeless future. Thanks to medical advancements, many with chronic conditions lead vibrant lives.
    I believe that conveying these facts through data visualization, rather than mere words and statistics, could offer solace to those caught in a spiral of negativity. Below, you'll find insights and data that inspire hope for a brighter, more normal future:</p>

        My theory is that at this critical halfway point in my talk, I heard a dry cough indicative of the audience's waning interest. This caused self-confidence to collapse and forced me out of my groove.<br/><br/>A competing theory is that I just hadn't practiced the last half of my speech as much.
